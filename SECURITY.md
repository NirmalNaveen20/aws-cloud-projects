## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in any of the projects under this repository, we encourage you to report it responsibly so that we can address it as soon as possible.

Please follow these steps to report a security vulnerability:

1. **Do not open a GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities.
2. Instead, please email the project maintainers directly at [nirmalnaveen95@gmail.com] with details about the vulnerability.

We will acknowledge the report as quickly as possible and work on a fix as soon as possible. We take security very seriously and will do everything we can to ensure that any vulnerabilities are dealt with in a timely manner.

To help keep this project secure, we follow best practices for secure coding:

- Regularly review and update dependencies.
- Follow principles of least privilege in cloud services.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.
- Ensure proper access control in AWS resources.
